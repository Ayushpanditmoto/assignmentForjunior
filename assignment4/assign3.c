// Assignment 4
// Q3 Write a C program to print the first n numbers
//  of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is
// constructed by adding the last two numbers of the sequence
// so far to get the next number in the sequence. The first and
//  second numbers of the sequence are defined as 0 and 1. We get:
//  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21â€¦
