// Write a C program which prints the first 10 happy numbers. If you iterate the process (assume maximum 100 iterations) of summing the squares of the decimal digits of a number and if the process terminates in 1, then the original number is called a Happy number. For example 7 is a happy number as 7 → 49 → 97 → 130 → 10 → 1.
